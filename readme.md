# Welcome!

This is your first test to ensure you understand the question format and how to respond appropriately. This will be a fairly simple task.

## Task Description

Your task is to calculate the sum of two integers, `a` and `b`.

## Input

You will be given two integers `a` and `b`, with each integer fulfilling the condition $0 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^{40}$.

## Output

Your program should output the sum of `a` and `b`, ensuring the result is less than or equal to $10^{50}$.

## Sample Input

1 2


## Sample Output

3


## Hints

### Where are the input and the output?

Your program should read input from stdin (Standard Input) and write output to stdout (Standard Output). 

For instance, in:

- C: You can use 'scanf' to read from stdin and 'printf' to write to stdout.
- C++: You can use 'cin' to read from stdin and 'cout' to write to stdout.
- Python: Use `sys.stdin.readline()` to read and `print()` to output.
- Java: Use `Scanner` to read and print to output.

Please refrain from outputting extra data to stdout other than what is required by the problem, such as "The answer is..." as this will lead to a "Wrong Answer".

## Submission

Please submit your solution in a main file named either `main.cpp`, `main.java`, `main.c`, or `main.py`. 

Use `test.py` to test your output.

## Differences with the Real ICPC

Unlike the real test, you won't have a time limit to work on the problem, you can see the correct answer, and you won't be penalized for wrong answers. 

Please note, however, that your program should still terminate within a reasonable time limit.

## Using Github Classroom

Github action will indicate if you pass or not. 

For example, the image below shows "pending judgement":

A green check mark indicates a successful submission:

A red color signifies a failed submission:
